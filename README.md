## Test Task ##

Please create a function using a loop to create the table. We prefer if you use JavaScript however, you
are free to use any programming language you are comfortable with. Please send your code as .txt or .js
Instructions: We have given definitions and formulas used in the table which you should refer to
understand the calculations and logic of the table. You are expected to create a function which would
output the given table even if the values in the definition changes. The values you may need for
calculation are highlighted in the definitions below.
Contingent Interest Rate: 12.20%* per annum, payable monthly at a rate of at least 1.01667%*, if applicable
Interest Barrier/Buffer Threshold: 90.00% of its Initial Value
Buffer Amount: 10.00%
Payment at Maturity
If the notes have not been redeemed early and the Final Value of each Underlying is greater than or equal to its Buffer
Threshold, you will receive a cash payment at maturity, for each $1,000 principal amount note, equal to (a) $1,000 plus (b)
the Contingent Interest Payment applicable to the final Review Date.
If the notes have not been redeemed early and the Final Value of any Underlying is less than its Buffer Threshold, your
payment at maturity per $1,000 principal amount note will be calculated as follows:
$1,000 + [$1,000 Ã— (Underlying Return + Buffer Amount)]

Contingent Interest
*If the notes have not been previously redeemed early and the closing level of Underlying on any Review Date is greater
than or equal to its Interest Barrier, you will receive on the applicable Interest Payment Date for each $1,000 principal
amount note a Contingent Interest Payment equal to at least $10.1667 (equivalent to a Contingent Interest Rate of at least
12.20% per annum, payable at a rate of at least 1.01667% per month).
